## Abstract
The purpose of the High Rate Sedimentation (HRS) Bottom Geometry is to determine a method for eliminating or reducing the floc blanket decay currently occurring in sedimentation tanks in the lab. The team hopes to accomplish this by developing a new shape and geometry for the bottom of the sedimentation tube in order to maximize the reuse of large settling flocs.

## Introduction
Explain how the completion of your challenge will affect AguaClara and the mission of providing safe drinking water (or sustainable wastewater treatment!). If this is a continuing team, how will your contribution build upon previous research? What needs to be further discovered or defined? If this is a new team, what prompted the inclusion of this team?

The main challenge for the Bottom Geometry team is finding an optimal bottom geometry of the tube settler. The bottom geometry influences

Finding an optimal bottom geometry of the tube settler is vital to sedimentation because it can increase sedimentation efficiency by evening the floc blanket in the settler. Sedimentation is a crucial part of a water treatment plants as it acts as the major removal method for suspended and coagulated minerals, dirt and particles.

A floc blanket is a dense layer of suspended flocs which allows particulates which have not coagulated, or coagulated particulates too small to settle, to attach onto the flocs which can be removed. Hence, vastly improving the efficiency and performance of a water treatment plant.

However, in the AguaClara lab, the floc blanket would initially form but would decay with time. Thus, the performance of the system drastically decreased. After discussions regarding the differences between the design of the sedimentation tanks in the plants and in the lab, the High Rate Sedimentation-Bottom Geometry team was created to determine the optimal shape of the input of water into the sedimentation tubes in the lab to ensure the consistent formation of a stable floc blankets.



## Literature Review and Previous Work
Discuss what is already known about your research area based on both external work and that of past AguaClara Teams. Connect your objectives with what is already known and explain what additional contribution you intend to make. Make sure to add APA formatted in-text citations. If you mention the author(s) in your sentence, you can simply give the year of publication.[(Logan et. al. 1987)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25043431.pdf?acceptTC=true)


## Methods
Explain the techniques you have used to acquire additional data and insights. Reserve fine detail for the Manual at the end of the report, but use this section to give an overview with enough detail for the reader to understand your Results and Analysis. Describe your apparatus, and have a justification for every decision you made and every parameter you chose in the design of the apparatus. Be especially careful to detail the conditions your experiments were conducted under, as this information is especially important for interpreting your results

Below, some example sections are given. Sectioning the report is meant to keep similar information together.  Continue making sections as necessary, or delete sections if you do not need them. Feel free to add subsubsections to further delineate the information. For example, under the Experimental Apparatus section below, the EStaRS team might consider having sections such as "Filter Design" and "Filter Fabrication".

### Experimental Apparatus
Explain your apparatus setup using enough detail such that future teams can recreate your apparatus. Make sure to explain why you built it this way.
* Design (calculations, constraints)

  $\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
* Schematic (label parts)

* Image (from lab; label parts)
* Materials (dimensions, materials)
* Complications in construction
* If already constructed: write a brief summary of important constraints, include any revisions to apparatus, also reference the prior report where construction is described

### Procedure
Discuss your experimental procedure. How did you run your experiment? What were you testing? What were the values of relevant parameters?

## Results and Analysis
Present an observation (results), then explain what happened (analysis).  Each paragraph should focus on one aspect of your results. In that same paragraph, you should interpret that result.  
In other words, there should not be two distinct paragraphs, but instead one paragraph containing one result and the interpretation and analysis of this result. Here are some guiding questions for results and analysis:

When describing your results, present your data, using the guidelines below:
* What happened? What did you find?
* Show your experimental data in a professional way.
```python
from aide_design.play import*
x = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
y = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
plt.figure('ax',(10,8))
plt.plot(x,y,'*')
plt.savefig('/Users/jillianwhiting/github/Jillian-Whiting/Images/linear')
plt.show()
```

Figure 1: Captions are very important for figures. Captions go below figures.

After describing a particular result, within a paragraph, go on to connect your work to fundamental physics/chemistry/statics/fluid mechanics, or whatever field is appropriate. Analyze your results and compare with theoretical expectations; or, if you have not yet done the experiments, describe your expectations based on established knowledge. Include implications of your results. How will your results influence the design of AguaClara plants? If possible provide clear recommendations for design changes that should be adopted. Show your experimental data in a professional way using the following guidelines:
* Why did you get those results/data?
* Did these results line up with expectations?
* What went wrong?
* If the data do not support your hypothesis, is there another hypothesis that describes your new data?

## Conclusions
Explain what you have learned and how that influences your next steps. Why does what you discovered matter to AguaClara?

Make sure that you defend your conclusions with facts and results.

## Future Work
Describe your plan of action for the next several weeks of research. Detail the next steps for this team. How can AguaClara use what you discovered for future projects? Your suggestions for challenges for future teams are most welcome. Should research in this area continue?

# Manual
The goal of this section is to provide all of the guidance that would be necessary for a future team to pick up your work where you left off. Please try to be thorough and put yourselves in the shoes of a newcomer to the project. Below are some recommended sections, but the manual will likely take a slightly different form for each team.

## Fabrication Details
Include any information related to the fabrication of equipment, experimental apparatuses, or technologies. Include the purpose of each step and the fabrication methods used. Reference appropriate safety precautions.

## Special Components
If your subteam uses a particular part that is unique and you could foresee a future subteam needing to order it or learn more about it, please include basic information like the vendor where it was purchased, catalog/item number, and a link to any documentation.

## Experimental Methods
### Set-up
Step 1.
* Put tasks in a sequential order.
* It is okay to have sub-lists.

### Cleaning Procedure

## Experimental Checklist
Another potential section could include a list of things that you need to check before running an experiment.

## ProCoDA Method File
Use this section to explain your method file. This could be broken up into several components as shown below:

### States
Here, you should describe the function of each state in your method file, both in terms of its overall purpose and also in terms of the details that make it distinct from other states. For example:
\begin{itemize}
\item \underline{OFF} - Resting state of ProCoDA. All sensors, relays, and pumps are turned off.
\end{itemize}

### Set Points
Here, you should list the set points used in your method file and explain their use as well as how each was calculated.

## Python Code

$g$: gravity
$\sigma$: dispersion
$a$: amplitude
